# Leetcode Notes

1. Dynamically maintain max/min -> priority queue
   
1. O(1) find -> map/set, depend on whether associate with value

2. Keep track of min/max value align with array order -> monotonic queue
   
3. Find closest min/max -> monotonic stack

4. quick find sum/mul -> prefix/suffix sum/mul

5. quick classify -> union find

6. unknown interval -> two pointers

7. known interval -> sliding window

8. Two pointer method1: while(condition): move right, update; move left until satisfies some condition, update; update answer

9.  Anagram -> counting sort

10. Tree related: find left, find right, satisfies condition -> do sth to root, else relate to left/right
