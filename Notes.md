# Leetcode Notes

1. Dynamically maintain max/min -> priority queue
   
1. O(1) find -> map/set, depend on whether associate with value

1. Keep track of min/max value align with array order -> min/max stack

1. quick find sum/mul -> prefix/suffix sum/mul

1. quick classify -> union find

1. unknown interval -> two pointers

1. known interval -> sliding window

1. Two pointer method1: while(condition): move right, update; move left until satisfies some condition, update; update answer
   
# Tricks

1. Anagram -> counting sort

1. Tree related: find left, find right, satisfies condition -> do sth to root, else relate to left/right
